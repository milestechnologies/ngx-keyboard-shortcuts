# Keyboard Shortcuts

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/milestechnologies/ngx-keyboard-shortcuts/_apis/build/status/milestechnologies.ngx-keyboard-shortcuts?branchName=develop)](https://dev.azure.com/milestechnologies/ngx-keyboard-shortcuts/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=develop) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/milestechnologies/ngx-keyboard-shortcuts/branch/develop/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/milestechnologies/ngx-keyboard-shortcuts)

This project is to help you create keyboard shortcuts in your angular applications. When we say keyboard shortcuts we are referring to something like Ctrl+C which would allow you to copy whatever you highlighted.
In this case you will be able to use our application to create keys that can do whatever you desire.

ngx-keyboard-shortcuts allows you to create and implement custom keybindings in your angular applications (ex. Ctrl+C for copy).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

If you are intending to use this repository you should be familiar with `angular`, and will need to install angular on your machine. The command needed to install angular is:
`npm install -g @angular/cli`

### Installing Our Package

Installation of ngx-keyboard-shortcuts requires the use of node package manager through the command: `npm install ngx-keyboard-shortcuts`.

### Demos

To access direct implementations of ngx-keyboard-shortcuts (demos), you're required to either clone or download the repository onto your machine. Once completed, a simple `npm start` will run the demo project, which can then be deployed in any browser search bar with **localhost:4200**.

## Running Coverage Tests

In order to run tests using **Karma** and **Jasmine** you will have to type the command
`npm run test`
This will then output the percentage of **Statements**, **Branches**, **Functions**, and **Lines** covered in your testing.
What these tests actually test is if the code gets executed will it do what it is supposed to do. The most important thing when testing is making sure that the **Statements** are 100% covered.
